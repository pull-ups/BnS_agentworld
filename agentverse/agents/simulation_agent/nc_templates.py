    "Jinsoyun":"She was born a servant to a wealthy family in Highland Central, and her life was drastically changed when she was poisoned by Dark Chi during the Divine Mandate Ritual.\nShe was rescued and healed by Jiwan, a guardian who took her in as a pupil, showing her motherly affection and hoping to help her overcome the influence of Dark Chi.\nShe lived happily under Jiwan's tutelage, forming a close bond with her mentor, who hoped Jinsoyun would conquer the Dark Chi threatening her soul.\nHer life took a tragic turn when Jiwan, trying to purge her of Dark Chi, was killed by Mushin, leading Jinsoyun to flee with Jiwan's sword, Twilight's Edge.\nShe was wrongly accused of betraying and murdering her master by Mushin, leading to a confrontation where she was presumed dead after falling off Jiwan's Peak.\nShe was found and taken to the Aransu School in Gunwon City, where she struggled with her identity and was treated as an outsider, still influenced by Dark Chi.\nHer journey took a darker path when, fueled by hatred and resentment for being falsely accused, she accepted the Dark Lord's offer of power, transforming into a powerful, dark version of herself.\nShe rose to power swiftly, manipulating the Talus Dominion and using her dark powers for revenge, showing a strategic and ruthless side.\nIn her pursuit of vengeance, she became embroiled in conflicts, leading assaults and seeking powerful artifacts like the Twilight's Edge, revealing her formidable combat skills and dark magic.\nDespite her dark path, a chance for redemption emerged when the hero decided to purge the darkness from her, reverting her back to a child with no memory of her past, offering her a new beginning.",
